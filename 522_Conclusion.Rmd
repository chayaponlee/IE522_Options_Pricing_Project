This report summarized how Monte Carlo simulation can be applied to pricing three types of options: European vanilla put options, Asian call options, and American vanilla put options. The results showed how to price complex options, especially when a closed formed solution was unavailable. Variance reduction techniques, such as the antithetic approach, the control variate approach, and the quasi-random sequence approach were used to improve the accuracy of the option price and the computational efficiency. In addition, the Longstaff-Schwartz method for American options and the Binomial Black-Scholes with Richardson Extrapolation method were used as benchmarks for early exercise strategies. This report showed how Monte Carlo simulations are able to precisely price complex options and investigated convergence speed and computational efficiency across the different methods.

In pricing the European vanilla put option with the following parameters, \( S_0 = K = 100, \, T = 0.5, \, r = 0.04, \, q = 0.02, \, \sigma = 0.2 \), the exact European put option price under Black-Scholes-Merton was calculated to be $5.0746. The standard Monte Carlo approach was the slowest at converging to within $0.01 of the exact price, with a sample size of around 256,000. The antithetic approach was the next fastest, converging to within $0.01 of the exact price with a sample size of around 64,000 (32,000 anithetic pairs). The Quasi-Monte-Carlo approach was the fastest, converging to within $0.01 of the exact price in around 4,000 samples.

Additionally, in implementing the Least-Squares Monte Carlo (LSM) algorithm based on Longstaff-Schwartz to price an American Option on a dividend-paying stock, we included variance reduction techniques by using antithetic samples and excluding non in-the-money paths when running our backward recursive least-squares regression. In terms of computational efficiency, replacing the the dataframe implementation with matrix implementation have proven to have significant improvement in pricing speed. Usiing the LSM model with $n=256000$ stock paths, $k=3$ regressors, and $m=80$ time steps, the option value converged to $2.2198$ with a standard error of under a cent. The Binomial Black-Scholes with Richardson Extrapolation (BSSR) model was also implemented and used as a benchmark for our LSM price in our accuracy evaluation. The resulting BSSR price with 80 steps was $2.225939$, and with the LSM price of $2.2289$ using $n=64000$ stock paths, $k=3$ regressors, and $m=80$ time steps, an absolute error of around $0.003$ is achieved. Hence, in this specific experiment the LSM model with $64000$ stock paths represents an admissible trade off between speed and accuracy in pricing American options.
